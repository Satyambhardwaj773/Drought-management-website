        <h1 style="text-align: center; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">OVERVIEW</h1>
        <p>Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare (DA & FW) is mandated to coordinate relief measures necessitated by drought, hailstorm, pest attack and cold wave/frost. Spatial distribution and quantum of rainfall during South-West Monsoon (June-September) mainly determines the incidence of drought in the country, as South-West Monsoon accounts for more than 70% of annual rainfall. DA & FW monitors progress of South-West Monsoon in the country, in close coordination with India Meteorological Department (IMD) and keeps a watch over deficient/scarcity rainfall conditions.

          Mahalanobis National Crop Forecast Centre (MNCFC), an attached office of the Department, also carries out drought assessment for 17 States of the country based on Drought Manual guidelines under National Agricultural Drought Assessment and Monitoring System (NADAMS) project, developed by National Remote Sensing Centre.
          
          The Department also reviews and updates the Crisis Management Plan (CMP) for drought every year. The Plan defines roles and responsibilities of various agencies involved in crisis management during drought.
          
          The State Governments initiate necessary relief measures in the wake of natural calamities from State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF), which is readily available with them. Contribution to SDRF is made by Central and State Governments in the ratio of 3:1 for 18 general category States (Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh & West Bengal) and in the ratio of 9:1 for 10 special category States (8 North Eastern States, namely, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura & Sikkim; and 2 Hilly States, namely, Himachal Pradesh & Uttarakhand). Government of India provides additional financial assistance from National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF), over and above SDRF, for natural calamities of severe nature as per established procedure and extant norms. Allocation under SDRF is made on the basis of recommendations of the Finance Commission.</p>

            <br>
            Plantation typically refers to the large-scale cultivation of crops or trees on a piece of land. This agricultural practice is often associated with monoculture, where a single crop or tree species is grown over vast expanses. Plantations are commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, where the climate is conducive to the growth of various cash crops such as coffee, tea, cocoa, sugarcane, bananas, palm oil, rubber, and timber.
            Historically, plantations have been significant drivers of economic development, particularly during periods of colonial expansion. They played a crucial role in supplying raw materials for global markets and were often characterized by labor-intensive production methods, including the use of enslaved or indentured workers.
            <!-- Forests play an important role in mitigating climate change: They absorb carbon dioxide in the air, reduce the risk of floods, increase biodiversity and, as a new study in Europe now shows, reforestation can significantly increase rainfall and help stave off drought.</td> -->

            <td><h2 style="text-align: center;">Rainwater Harvesting</h2>
              <br>
              River harvesting, also known as river water harvesting or riverbank filtration, is a method of harnessing water resources from rivers for various purposes, including drinking water supply, irrigation, and industrial use. This technique involves capturing and treating water directly from rivers or streams, usually near their banks, to utilize it for human consumption or agricultural needs.

            The process of river harvesting typically involves several steps:
            Intake Structures: Structures are built along the riverbanks to capture water from the river. These intake structures may include screens or filters to remove debris and large particles from the water.
            Filtration and Treatment: Once water is captured from the river, it undergoes filtration and treatment processes to remove impurities, sediment, and pathogens. This may involve physical filtration, chemical treatment, and disinfection to ensure that the water meets quality standards for its intended use.

            <td><h2 style="text-align: center;">Desalination of Water</h2>
              <br>
              Desalination is a process that removes salt and other minerals from saline water, typically seawater, to produce freshwater suitable for human consumption or agricultural use. As freshwater resources become increasingly strained due to factors such as population growth, urbanization, and climate change, desalination has emerged as a crucial technology for supplementing traditional water supplies.
            The desalination process involves several methods, the two most common being:
            Reverse Osmosis (RO): This method uses a semi-permeable membrane to separate salts and other impurities from water. Pressurized water is forced through the membrane, allowing only freshwater molecules to pass through, while salts and contaminants are retained and flushed away. RO is widely used for both small-scale and large-scale desalination projects due to its efficiency and relatively low energy consumption.

            <td><h2 style="text-align: center;">Drip Irrigation</h2>
              <br>
              Drip irrigation is a highly efficient method of watering crops by delivering small, controlled amounts of water directly to the roots of plants through a network of pipes, tubes, and emitters. Unlike traditional irrigation methods such as flood irrigation or sprinkler systems, which can result in water wastage through runoff or evaporation, drip irrigation applies water precisely where it is needed, minimizing water loss and optimizing water use efficiency.
            The basic components of a drip irrigation system include:
            Emitters: These are small devices attached to the distribution network that release water in a controlled manner. Emitters can be inline, integrated into the drip tubing, or individual emitters placed directly at the base of each plant.
            Distribution Network: This consists of pipes, tubes, or hoses that carry water from the water source to the emitters. The distribution network is typically laid out along rows of crops or around individual plants.

              <br>
              Genetically modified crops, often abbreviated as GMOs (genetically modified organisms), are plants whose genetic material has been altered using genetic engineering techniques. These modifications are typically aimed at introducing desirable traits such as resistance to pests, diseases, or herbicides, as well as improving nutrient content or increasing yield. GMOs have sparked debates regarding their safety, environmental impact, and ethical considerations. Proponents argue that they offer solutions to global food security challenges by increasing crop productivity and reducing reliance on chemical inputs, while opponents express concerns about potential health risks, biodiversity loss, and corporate control over the food supply. Despite the controversies, genetically modified crops continue to be cultivated worldwide, with adoption rates varying across different regions and crops.

              <br>
              Recycling organic waste involves the systematic collection, processing, and reuse of biodegradable materials such as food scraps, yard waste, and other organic matter. Through composting or anaerobic digestion, these materials are broken down into nutrient-rich soil amendments or biogas, reducing the burden on landfills and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. Recycling organic waste not only diverts waste from landfills but also creates valuable resources for agriculture and renewable energy production. It promotes sustainable waste management practices, conserves natural resources, and fosters a circular economy where waste becomes a valuable resource rather than a liability, contributing to a healthier environment and a more sustainable future.

            <br>
            Conserving water is essential for sustainable living and environmental preservation. With growing population and increasing demands on freshwater resources, efficient water management becomes imperative. Conserving water involves adopting practices that minimize wastage and promote responsible usage. This includes fixing leaks, using water-efficient appliances, practicing mindful irrigation techniques, and reusing water where possible. By conserving water, we not only safeguard our natural ecosystems but also ensure an adequate supply of clean water for future generations. It's a crucial step towards mitigating water scarcity and building resilience in the face of climate change.
